# Week 3 â€” Decentralized Authentication

Decentralized authentication means no central authority is required to verify your identity, i.e., decentralized identifiers. DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) are unique identifiers that allow for decentralized, verified digital identification.

### Amazon Cognito
Amazon Cognito provides authentication, authorization, and user management for your web and mobile apps. Your users can sign in directly with a user name and password, or through a third party such as Facebook, Amazon, Google or Apple. The two main components of Amazon Cognito are user pools and identity pools. User pools are user directories that provide sign-up and sign-in options for your app users. Identity pools enable you to grant your users access to other AWS services. You can use identity pools and user pools separately or together.
